# Collapsed Mastodon 
Collapses the main Mastodon column for a cleaner view of the other timelines and shows small floating containers to write toots/make searchs and integrates replies below the target post.

It was originally developed as an addon by Óliver García Albertos, but then converted to a tampermonkey userscript by me (RX14).
You can install it from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RX14/collapsed_mastodon/main/Collapsed%20Mastodon.user.js).
